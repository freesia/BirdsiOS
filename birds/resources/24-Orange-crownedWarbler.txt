Orange-crowned Warbler

A small, rather drab warbler of shrubs and low vegetation, the Orange-crowned Warbler is common and widespread in the West, but is much less common in most of the East. It can be one of the most numerous migrant warblers in the western and central United States, but its numbers decrease to the east.
