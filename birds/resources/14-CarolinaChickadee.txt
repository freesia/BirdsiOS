Carolina Chickadee

Chickadees are small woodland birds that are often found flocking with their close relatives the Tufted Titmouse. These birds are distinguished by their back ‘cap’ and ‘bib’ field marks and their often excitable behavior. They feed on mostly on insects, spiders, seeds, and berries. Call: Chick-a-dee-dee-dee or fee-bee fee-bay.
