American Crow

Perhaps the most intelligent of our birds, the resourceful and highly social Crow is often heard calling from tree tops or found roosting in large groups. This is a large bird (up to 19” long) with solid black coloration. They are opportunists that eat small animals, carrion, fruit, eggs, garbage, or just about anything else that is edible. Call: Crows use a variety of calls for specific situations. It has been estimated that they may have more than 30 distinct calls! The most common of these calls is the familiar and loud CAW.
