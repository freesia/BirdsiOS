Northern Mockingbird

The State Bird of Texas, the Mockingbird is at home near the edges of woodlands. This bird’s medium build and mostly gray body provide good camouflage in this habitat. It flashes bright white wing patches while in flight. Mockingbirds eat many different types of fruit including grapes, elderberries, blackberries, mulberries and even poison ivy berries.
