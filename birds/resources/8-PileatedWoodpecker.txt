Pileated Woodpecker

The most majestic of the Nature Center’s birds is the Pileated Woodpecker. This spectacular woodpecker reaches the size of a crow (it is the largest woodpecker in North America) and sports a bright red crest and blackish body. If the image of the Pileated Woodpecker looks familiar it may be because the Pileated Woodpecker served as the model for ‘Woody Woodpecker’. Pileated Woodpeckers feed mostly on carpenter ants and termites which live under the bark of large trees and supplement this diet throughout the year with grapes and nuts. Like many other woodpeckers this bird will proclaim its territory by drumming. The drumming is more frequent by unpaired males and is distinctive among woodpeckers as it softens toward the end. Call: A loud wuck note or series of notes given often during flight.
