Blue Jay

Blue Jays are medium sized woodland birds with brilliant blue and white coloration. Males and females are externally identical and both assist in rearing of young. Like their larger cousins the crow, Jays are good mimics oftentimes heard imitating hawks. Blue jays are omnivores; they feed on seeds, nuts, and berries, insects, small mammals, amphibians, fish, and even the eggs and young of other birds round out the blue jay's diet. Call: A loud Jay! Jay! Jay!
